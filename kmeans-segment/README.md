## Conclusion
In this project I used unsupervised machine learning model. I performed dimensionality reduction to eliminate redundant features along with agglomerative clustering that cluster customers into 5 different segment based on their similarities. This analysis can be further implemented with the help of the marketing team to send meaasages and other marketing strategies to the targeted audience.
