# Customer Segmentation Analysis 😌 😠 😐 😑
Customer Segmentation Analysis is mostly use in marketing to target different customer segment with right messaging and for other business purposes. It is a detailed analysis of the company's ideal customers.

It helps the business understand it customers better and makes it easier to modify product to the right customers according to their specific need and behaviour which inturn improves marketing process. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

## Method of Analysis
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning model that clusters customers into different segment based on their similarities.

## Conclusion
In this project I used unsupervised machine learning model. I performed dimensionality reduction to eliminate redundant features along with agglomerative clustering that cluster customers into 5 different segment based on their similarities. This analysis can be further implemented with the help of the marketing team to send meaasages and other marketing strategies to the targeted audience.
