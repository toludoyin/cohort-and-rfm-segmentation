# Methodology

### RFM Analysis
In this project I used cohort analysis and RFM metrics to classify customers into different segment. These makes it possible for marketers to target specific customers with personalized and differenciated marketing strategies, track transaction performance and make tactical decision. The RFM is an acronym for;

* R - recency, measures when last a customer made a purchase or carry out transactions with the product.

* F - frequency, measures how often customers purchase.

* M - monetary value, measures how much value the customers have spent in purchasing the brand product.

### Cohort Analysis
Cohort Analysis is a tool in behavioural analytics that measures retention and customer life-time value. It segment customers based on their similarities e.g period of signups which makes it possible to track transaction behaviour and trends of each cohort over time. There are 3 types of cohort; behaviour, time and size cohort.

Cohort analysis help the business indentify the highest and lowest cohort over time which will contribute to decision making that will help reduce churn and optimize revenue generation.

# Project Purpose
The aim of the project is to help the business understand its customers and track transaction performance inorder to improve marketing effort (in terms of customer experience, relationship, communication), loyalty, retention and reduce churn rate that will yield valueable revenue for the business.
