# RFM Customer Segmentation
In this project I used RFM metrics to classify customers into different segment.This make it possible for marketers to target specific customers with communications. The RFM represent;

* R - recency, when last did a customer purchase a product.

* F - frequency, how often did they purchase the product.

* M - monetary value, how much value the customers have spent in purchasing the brand product.

The aim of the project is to help the businness understand its customers and their transaction performance inorder to improve customer marketing experience, relationship, loyalty and retention that will yield  valueable revenue for the business.
