# RFM Customer Segmentation
In this project I used RFM metrics to classify customers into different segment. The RFM represent;

* R - recency, when last did a customer purchase a product.

* F - frequency, how often did they purchase the company's product.

* M - monetary value, how much have they spent in purchasing goods in the company.

The aim of the project is to help the businness understand its customers and their transaction performance inorder to improve user experience that will yield revenue.
