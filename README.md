# RFM Customer Segmentation
In this project I used RFM metrics to classify customers into different segment. The RFM represent;

* R - recency, when last did a customer purchase a product.

* F - frequency, how often did they purchase the company's product.

* M - monetary value, how much have they spent in purchasing goods in the company.
