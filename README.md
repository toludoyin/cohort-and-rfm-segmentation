# RFM Customer Segmentation
The online retail dataset from UCI ML repo was collected from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jihyeseo/online-retail-data-set-from-uci-ml-repo. The dataset content contain a company data that mainly sells unique all-occassion gifts. With majority of the customers been wholesalers.

In this project I used cohort analysis and RFM metrics to classify customers into different segment. These makes it possible for marketers to target specific customers with communications and also tack their transaction performace. The RFM represent;

* R - recency, when last did a customer purchase a product.

* F - frequency, how often did they purchase the product.

* M - monetary value, how much value the customers have spent in purchasing the brand product.

# Cohort Analysis
Cohort Analysis is a tool in behavioural analytics that measures retention and customer life-time value. It segment customers based on their similarities e.g period of signups which makes it possible to track transaction behaviour and trends of each cohort over time. There are 3 types of cohort; behaviour, time and size cohort.

Cohort analysis help the business indentify the highest and lowest cohort over time which will contribute to decision making that will help reduce churn and optimize revenue generation.

# Project Purpose
The aim of the project is to help the business understand its customers and track transaction performance inorder to improve customer marketing experience, relationship, loyalty, retention and reduce churn rate that will yield valueable revenue for the business.
