# RFM Customer Segmentation
In this project I used cohort analysis and RFM metrics to classify customers into different segment.These makes it possible for marketers to target specific customers with communications. The RFM represent;

* R - recency, when last did a customer purchase a product.

* F - frequency, how often did they purchase the product.

* M - monetary value, how much value the customers have spent in purchasing the brand product.

Cohort Analysis is a tool in behavioural analytics that measures retention and customer life-time value. It segment customers based on their similarities e.g period of signups which makes it possible to track transaction performace or behaviour of each cohort over time. This analysis help the business indentify the highest and lowest cohort over time which will contribute to decision making that will help reduce churn and optimize revenue generation.

The aim of the project is to help the business understand its customers and their transaction performance inorder to improve customer marketing experience, relationship, loyalty, retention and reduce churn rate that will yield valueable revenue for the business.
